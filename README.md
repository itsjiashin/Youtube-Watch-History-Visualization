![Background and Overview]
This project analyzes my personal YouTube watch history from late-July to October 2025 to uncover insights about my viewing patterns on Youtube. Using data exported from Google Takeout, I preprocessed the raw JSON files in Python, uploaded the cleaned dataset to AWS S3, and queried it with AWS Athena for some exploratory data analysis.

The results were visualized in Tableau to explore trends such as how my viewing habits changed across months, which weekdays I watched most often, and what times of day I was most active on YouTube.
